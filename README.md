# UFOs

## Purpose/Overview
In this project I was tasked with creating a webpage to show information about different UFO sightings.  The page needed to have several components.  First it needed to show a paragraph that was provided for me.  Next, the page needed to have a table of information that was pulled from javascript data file.  This information needed to be put organized and neatly put into a table with several columns.  Lastly, the table needed to have filters.  These filters could be used to find data based on the date, city, state, country, or description of a UFO sighting.
