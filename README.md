# UFOs

## Purpose/Overview
In this project I was tasked with creating a webpage to show information about different UFO sightings.  The page needed to have several components.  First it needed to show a paragraph that was provided for me.  Next, the page needed to have a table of information that was pulled from javascript data file.  This information needed to be put organized and neatly put into a table with several columns.  Lastly, the table needed to have filters.  These filters could be used to find data based on the date, city, state, country, or description of a UFO sighting.  

## Analysis
The code created was able to filter on several parameters.  These parameters become activated when an input has been completed.  In other words, as soon as a filter is put into a filter box and then the user clicks elsewhere, the data table will update to provide information from only those filters.  If a person selects another filter, the table will update with information that satifies both inputs.  The filters are located on the left side of the page and should look like the following image:  
It should also be noted that an example of each input is inside of the input box.  For example, the date box shows the format the input should have in order for it to work correctly.

There are two more images posted here.  These images show the following things:
1. The first image shows the table before any filters are put in place.

3. The second image shows the table after I filtered the data to only January 12 in the state of California.  The produced exactly one match.  This match, however, shows all of the information about this particular sighting.

In order to reset the table, the user can click the "UFO Sightings" phrase in the upper left corner of the page.

## Summary
Overall, the webpage and code do what is needed to present the information.  The colors that are used contrast well and make each word visible to the reader.  The table is also easy to read and is organized in a convenient matter.

### Drawbacks
There are some downsides to presenting the page in its current state.  
- First, if more data is collect it will become more inconivenient for the entire table to be presented on the webpage.  The data that was collected is for a small amount of time and there is certainly more data to collect.
- Second, I personally would prefer a button to click to filter the data.  The input method in its current state requires the user to click off of the filter.  A button would take away any confusion.

### Recommendations
The following are recommendations for improving the website:
1. First, I would create a filter button instead(This was discussed above)
2. I would also try to create a range of possible dates.  As the data grows, it might be nice to select a range of possible dates.
